# ARES

Serpent - A All-in-One VRChat mod to suit all your needs using [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader)
# **You need at least MelonLoader v0.5.4**

## Description
A Heavily modified ReModCE with a loads of new features and modified to use the ARES API

If you want a feature or have a bug report, head over to the issues page and create an issue for it!  

## Installation & Usage
Grab the latest loader from [here](https://github.com/Dean2k/Serpent/releases/latest/Serpent.Loader.dll) and put it in your Mods directory.

By default the loader will attempt to load the mod from your VRChat directory using the filename 'ReModCE.dll'. If it doesn't exist, it will attempt to download the latest Version from GitHub.  
If there is a newer version available on GitHub it will automatically update to that version.  

If you don't want automatic updates, you can open your MelonPreferences.cfg with any text editor and set **ParanoidMode** in the **[Serpent]** category to **true**. That way the loader will notify if there is a new version available, but it won't load it until you download it yourself and replace the old version.  
In case you want to update you can always grab the latest and even previous versions of Serpent.dll [here](https://github.com/Dean2k/Serpent/releases/).
